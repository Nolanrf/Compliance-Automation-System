This project automates compliance tracking by integrating SafetyCulture, Google Tasks, and Google Sheets. Whenever a new action item is created in SafetyCulture, a corresponding task is generated in Google Tasks, and the details are logged in Google Sheets for tracking and reporting. This eliminates manual task creation, improves accountability, and streamlines the follow-up process for compliance issues.
Features:
- Automated Task Creation – When a compliance action is recorded in SafetyCulture, a corresponding task is created in Google Tasks.
- Dynamic Due Dates – Tasks are assigned due dates based on priority:
  High Priority: 1-2 days
  Medium Priority: 3-4 days
  Low Priority: 7 days  
- Google Sheets Integration – Logs all action items for tracking, reporting, and audit purposes.
- Notifications & Follow-Ups (Future Enhancement) – Potential integration with Slack/Email to notify assigned users of compliance tasks.
- Data-Driven Reporting – Google Sheets can be used for dashboards and trend analysis of compliance issues.
